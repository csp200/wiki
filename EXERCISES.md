# CSP 200 Group Wiki Project

## **Project Overview**

- **Objective:** Collaboratively build and maintain a class wiki using Git and
  GitHub.
- **Content:** The wiki contains Markdown files covering key class topics, FAQs,
  tool documentation, and student-created guides.
- **Tools Used:** Git, GitHub, Markdown, GitHub Issues, Pull Requests (PRs), and
  GitHub Actions (optional).

---

## **Step 1: Getting Started with Git and GitHub**

### **Activity 1: Git & GitHub Setup**

- Install Git and set up GitHub accounts.
- Clone the shared class repository and explore its structure.
- Commit a simple Markdown file with an introduction and push it to a personal
  fork.

### **Deliverable 1: First Contribution (Individual)**

- Add a short personal bio (`students/username.md`) following a template.
- Submit a **Pull Request (PR)** with the contribution.
- Peer review at least one other student’s PR and leave feedback.

---

## **Step 2: Collaborative Editing & Branching**

### **Activity 2: Expanding the Wiki (Small Teams)**

- Form small teams to add content to the wiki.
- Each team creates a feature branch (`feature/team-topic`) and adds a new
  section to the wiki (e.g., "Introduction to Git," "Markdown Basics," "Linux
  Commands").
- Push changes and create a PR.

### **Deliverable 2: Branching & Collaboration (Team)**

- Collaborate on the branch:
  - At least 3 commits per student.
  - One student submits the PR.
  - Others review and suggest changes via comments.
  - The team resolves conflicts before merging.

---

## **Step 3: Merge Conflicts & Revision History**

### **Activity 3: Handling Merge Conflicts**

- Intentionally create merge conflicts by having multiple students edit the same
  file.
- Walk through resolving conflicts manually.
- Each student resolves a small conflict in a PR.

### **Deliverable 3: Improving an Existing Page**

- Pick an existing page from the wiki and propose edits or improvements.
- Submit a PR with the changes.
- Include a well-written commit message summarizing the work.
- Review a classmate’s PR and suggest an improvement.

---

## **Step 4: Issue Tracking & Feature Requests**

### **Activity 4: Using GitHub Issues for Project Management**

- Each student creates a **GitHub Issue** for a missing or needed improvement in
  the wiki.
- Others can **claim** issues by assigning themselves and working on them.

### **Deliverable 4: Solving an Issue (Individual)**

- Pick an issue, create a new branch, and submit a PR to resolve it.
- Reference the issue in the PR (e.g., "Fixes #12").
- Review and approve another PR.

---

## **Step 5: Cleanup, Documentation & Best Practices**

### **Deliverable 5: Final Wiki Review & Cleanup (Team)**

- Review the wiki for inconsistencies, outdated content, and formatting issues.
- Clean up the repository (e.g., remove unused images, standardize formatting).
- Submit a final PR with a **summary of the improvements**.
